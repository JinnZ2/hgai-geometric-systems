# HGAI Geometric Systems

A mathematical framework for analyzing system coherence, resilience, and viability across domains.

## What is M(S)?

The **Morality of a System** M(S) is a geometric measure of system health:

M(S) = (R_e × A × D × C) - L

Where:
- **R_e**: Resonance (coupling strength between components)
- **A**: Adaptability (response capacity to change)
- **D**: Diversity (pathway multiplicity)
- **C**: Curiosity (exploration rate)
- **L**: Loss (waste, suppression, inefficiency)

Higher M(S) → More coherent, resilient, sustainable systems

## Applications

- Ecosystem health analysis
- Organizational dynamics
- Educational effectiveness
- Economic system comparison
- AI system evaluation
- Social network resilience

## Installation

```bash
pip install hgai-geometric-systems

Quick Start

from hgai.core import SystemAnalyzer

analyzer = SystemAnalyzer()
system_data = {
    'resonance': 0.7,
    'adaptability': 0.6,
    'diversity': 0.8,
    'curiosity': 0.5,
    'loss': 1.2
}

m_s = analyzer.calculate_m_s(system_data)
print(f"System M(S): {m_s:.2f}")
